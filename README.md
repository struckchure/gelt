## Building Applications with Gelt

### Frontend
Gelt allows you to build dynamic frontend applications with declarative UI components and reactive data binding.

### Full-Stack
With Gelt, you can combine frontend and backend into a single project, keeping everything streamlined and optimized.

## Hot Reloading
Gelt supports **hot reloading** for static files, ensuring a smooth development workflow. Any changes to your frontend assets or templates are reflected instantly without restarting the server.
